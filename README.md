# Beta-VAE Graph Theory and Counterfactual Constraint Optimization

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of beta-Variational Autoencoders (beta-VAE), graph theory, and counterfactual reasoning through constraint optimization, with applications on the MNIST dataset and real-world biological data. The goal is to enhance the interpretability and applicability of machine learning models in understanding complex datasets, particularly focusing on the generation and analysis of counterfactuals in a structured data space.

### Objectives

- Implement a beta-VAE model to learn meaningful latent representations of the MNIST dataset and biological data.
- Apply graph theory principles to organize and interpret the latent space in terms of data relationships and dependencies.
- Develop a counterfactual constraint optimization approach to explore potential outcomes and their implications within the datasets.

## Results

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining beta-VAE, graph theory, and counterfactual reasoning in analyzing both the MNIST dataset and real-world biological data. We have achieved significant improvements in model interpretability, fidelity of generated data, and the ability to perform meaningful counterfactual analyses. This design proves to be highly beneficial, especially when paired with the right data and a dedicated clinical team, opening new avenues for research and application in bioinformatics and healthcare.
